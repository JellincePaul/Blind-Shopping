# Blind-Shopping
Actually this helps THE BLIND AND MAKES THEM FEEL THAT HEY ARE DOING REAL SHOPPING AND WITHOUT SEEKING OTHERS HELP, just like how others do in big shops like Walmart etc.
This is a scanner app, and what this does is, it reads the qrcode that is pasted on the stand of the product. The device will be in the 
trolley and as it is being moved it will read the qr code and it will indicate the products name and weight and also the price.
It might be lengthy process but they can feel and do without being dependent on others.
If they have no idea of buying soaps or any other particular product,then they can just move faster as in the starting of the racks, 
it will be mentioned that, this area is full of soaps or liquid wash or etc. So it will help in reducing their time in purchase.
